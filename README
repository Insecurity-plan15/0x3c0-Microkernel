This is mostly a file to stop GitHub from pestering me.

My operating system doesn't really have a purpose. IPC is still only basic, some system calls are still stubbed, and the only program it loads is a bootstrap. But it's my operating system, and I like how it's turning out - as a learning experience, and a way for me to learn about the internals of a computer.

To compile my operating system, you'll need G++ 4.5.0 - 4.3.0 may work, but I haven't tested later uploads.

My operating system doesn't actually do anything visible for the moment, so it shouldn't do anything to your hard drive. Nevertheless, use at your own risk.

Finally, some legal stuff. Feel free to use any of my code for learning purposes; if you directly copy any of my files, credit me in some way, including the link to the repository. There is one exception to this rule; do not copy my code in any project bound by a license more restrictive than the BSD license, unless I have given my written permission. I retain the right to alter the terms of this legal agreement at any time; these alterations cannot be retroactive.

If you want to discuss the licensing rules, or have any suggestions, feel free to send me a message (or however GitHub lets users communicate.) Spam and flames are not welcome, and will be summarily ignored.
